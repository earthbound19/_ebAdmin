:: DESCRIPTION
:: Terminates a wide variety of processes which may be found on Windows computers which I often consider extraneous or even resource hogging, including stopping such services. I don't recommend anyone to just run this script nilly-willy unless you are very sure you don't need the processes in it to run (as I am sure for myself, but I have only examined them for my own purposes, which my vary from yours).

:: DEPENDENCIES
:: process.exe Command Line Process Viewer/Killer/Suspender for Windows, from beyondlogic.org installed in your PATH.

:: USAGE
:: Run without any parameters:
::    killHogApps.bat


:: CODE
:: TO DO: Find the exact name of the FlashP* / FlashU* executables and use the found name to terminate those.
:: I am experimenting with disabling the secondary logon service, "seclogon."
:: Also, it may be more secure to disable the network list service, "netprofm."

% DESCRIPTION
% Force removes all the Windows Store apps that are _components_ (and should not be components) of Windows 8+.

% USAGE
% Run from an elevated powershell terminal, from a directory that has this script in it:
%    interactiveWinAppStoreUninstall.ps
% You may need to set powershell execution policy first to allow execution of this.


% CODE
Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Out-GridView -PassThru | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online

% remove the user's apps:
Get-AppXPackage -User | Remove-AppxPackage

% remove all system-wide apps,
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage

% then prevent them from reinstalling for other users:
Get-AppXProvisionedPackage -online | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage –online

% BUT: It’s..likely that future updates (especially major updates) could reinstall those apps.

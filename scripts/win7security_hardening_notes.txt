re: https://www.csoonline.com/article/2619720/how-to-defeat-the-new-rdp-exploit----the-easy-way.html
- change any network-exposed services to use alternate, uncommon ports
- admin websites should not be run on port 80 or even 443
- SSH shouldn't be listening on port 22
- telnet hosts shouldn't be listening on port 23
- regrettably, FTP only works on ports 21 and 22 (in passive mode or active mode)

- disable or rename these executables:
  - mstsc.exe
  - rdpclip.exe

Learned from sad experience :( :
- _Don't forward ports from your router to your computer unless you safeguard those ports_.

- Linux has a built-in firewall (look up the service name) which can whitelist ports (which has the effect of blocking everything other than what is on the whitelist).

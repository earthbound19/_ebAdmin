# to backup and restore the boot sector:
# backup:
dd bs=1 count=446 if=/dev/sda of=/cygdrive/c/bootsector.bin
# restore:
dd bs=1 count=446 if=/cygdrive/c/bootsector.bin of=/dev/sda

# to backup and restore the partition table:
# backup:
dd bs=1 skip=446 count=64 if=/cygdrive/c/partitiontable.bin of=/dev/sda
# restore:
dd bs=1 seek=446 count=64 if=/cygdrive/c/partitiontable.bin of=/dev/sda

to do both, backup and restore 64+446 bytes?

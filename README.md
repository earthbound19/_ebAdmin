# DESCRIPTION

A collection of scripts etc., the vast majority developed by me (`earthbound19`/RAH), which I use mostly for computer or tool administrative etc. purposes, possibly mostly on Windows.


# USAGE etc.

Not yet documented other than in comments in scripts etc.


## LICENSE
Everything in this repository which I have created I dedicate to the Public Domain, unless comments in or near any code state otherwise.

I believe that everything not created by me in this archive is at least freely available and open source. If you have copyright control of anything in this archive and wish for it to be removed, please contact me and I will do so: [http://earthbound.io/contact](http://earthbound.io/contact "http://earthbound.io/contact")


## NOTE

This repository was previously part of a repository named `_ebDev`, which itself was previously title `\_devtools`. I could have teleported the git history into this, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't think the file history is important here.

Also this repository is highly subject to flux and my whims.
